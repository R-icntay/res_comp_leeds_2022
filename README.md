Talk for the [Research Computing Leeds Conference](https://rescompleedscon.github.io/conference2022/schedule/): Save your tears for the data - A touch of Docker in a Data Scientist's workflow. In

### Abstract

Many data science teams have become multilingual, leveraging R, Python, Julia and friends in their work. Into the bargain, different data scientists have different preferences in their coding environments and operating systems. While this diversity allows data scientists to work with the tools they are most comfortable with, it can become a pain to share the same projects on different machines with different configurations. This talk illustrates how data scientists can leverage **Dev Containers** to create portable, reproducible and tailored development environments, which can be instantiated reliably in different environments, operating systems and hardware. Data scientists can therefore focus on what they love and do best (i.e data science) without having to worry about the hassle required to reproduce their work, deploy their analysis dashboards or even deploy their models.

### Demo
We create a dev container that can support data science tasks in **R**, **Python**, **VS Code** and **RStudio**.
